# Project Objective
Real time multi user chat application developed using sockets and web socket protocol

## Prerequisites
	Socket, Web Socket and Web Socket Secure

## Terminology
	Socket : It is an end-point in a two way communication line between two programs within a network using a communication protocol

	Web Socket Protocol : A communication protocol which allows multi way communication at the same time


## Why I chose ws Protocol?

## HTTP vs WS
	1. HTTP allows one way communication at a time whereas WS allows multi way communication at a time
	2. In HTTP, client-server architecuture is followed whereas In WS, clients and server both can push updates simultaneously that makes the web app faster and efficient

## Socker.IO
	event driven JS library for developing real time web application
	Refer here at : https://socket.io/
